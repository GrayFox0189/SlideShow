<p align="left">If, like me, you're looking for a super simple program to load your images and make them slide, then you're in the right place.<br><br>What can I say about myself? Well, I've never programmed before. I have ZERO experience in this field. Despite that, I've always worked in IT, I love it, and I've been passionate about it since my first IBM 5150.<br><br>Tired of using Windows' built-in slideshow, which lets you add music, transitions, and more (but not a timer to set the speed), I went looking for a simple program. Maybe I didnâ€™t search well enough, but I couldn't find one that fit my basic needs. So, I took the plunge, opened GitHub Copilot, chose a language that seemed the simplest (Python), and put together this "program" that looks like it came straight from the '80s... but hey, it works! It can read *.png, *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.gif, *.bmp.<br><br>The functionality is simple.<br><br>Click "Select Folder" if you want to choose a folder containing all the desired images.<br>Click "Select Image" if you want to pick only specific images from a folder.<br>Move the slider to set the time between images (min 3 sec, max 30 sec) and press the spacebar.<br>That's it.<br><br>If you want to switch to Fullscreen mode, just click the dedicated button, and press Esc to exit.<br><br>You can also navigate forward and backward through the images using the arrow keys.<br><br>That's all.<br></p>
